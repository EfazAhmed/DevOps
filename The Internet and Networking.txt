	• Basics of Networking
	• The Internet is a interconnections of computers around the world
	• We call these interconnections a Network
	• The Internet - the physical connection of computers and wires around the world
	• The Web - the information on the internet
	• Servers store the websites that we use
	• Clients request the content from servers
	• IPS are connected to clients
	• Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address
	• MAC address is hard coded onto the device
	• When you send or receive data through a network you need to have both an IP and a MAC address
	• Data that are sent over networks are called packets (binary forms like 0s and 1s)

	• Networking Hardware
	• Ethernet Cable is a physical connection from computer to network
	• WI-FI (wireless networking)
		○ Radios
		○ Antennas
	• Fiber Optic Cables
		○ Expensive
		○ Greater speeds
		○ Cables contain glass fibers that transfer data through light
		○ Router - connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic
	• Switches and Hubs also help data travel 
		○ Switches - figures out where to send data
		○ Hubs - sends data to everyone
	• Network Stack - a set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer

	• Networking - Language of the Internet
	• Networking Protocols
		○ Routed efficiently
		○ Aren't corrupted
		○ Secure
		○ Right machine
		○ Named appropriately
	• TCP/IP
		○ (Internet Protocol) IP - delivers packets to right computers
		○ (Transmission Control Protocol) TCP - Delivers information from one network to another

	• Networking - The Web
	• All websites can be accessed through the web
	• URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - a web address
		○ "www" - world wide web
		○ "reddit" - domain name
			§ Once a name is taken, it'll be registered in ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
		○ ".com" - standard for what type of website it might be
	• DNS (Domain Name System)
		○ Acts like internet directory
