	• Operating System - The whole package that manages our computer's resources and lets us interact with it
		○ Kernel Space
			§ Main Core
			§ Talks to our hardware
			§ File storage and management
				□ File System - how we manage our files
					® Folders
					® Directories
			§ Process management
			§ Memory management
			§ I/O management
				□ Anything that can give us input, or that we can use for output of data
		○ User Space
			§ Everything outside the kernel
			§ UI
	• Windows
		○ Microsoft
		○ Business and consumer space
		○ PC
	• Mac 
		○ Consumer Space
	• Linux
		○ Open source OS
		○ Business Infrastructure and in Consumer Space
		○ Has different versions
			§ Ubuntu
			§ Debian
			§ Red Hat
		Chrome and Android OS both runs the Linux kernel underneath the hood
	
	
	• File and File Systems
	• File Handling
		○ Data
		○ Metadata
			§ File extension - The appended part of a file name that  tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems
			§ File Owner
			§ Permissions
			§ File Size
			§ Data Modified
			§ Date Created
			§ File Type
		○ File System
			§ Windows - NTFS
				□ Encryptions
				□ Faster Access Speeds
				□ Security
			§ MAC - HFS+
				□ Journaled
			§ Linux - ext4
	• We write to our hard drive in the form of data blocks
	• Block Storage - Improves faster handling of data because that data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker

	• Process Management 
		○ Process - a program that's executable, like our internet browser or text editor
		○ Program - an application that we can run, like Chrome
	• The kernel has to worry about multiple processes at once
	• CPU processes each process one by one
		○ Time Slice -  a very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution
	• Kernel - Creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated

	• Memory Management
	• Virtual Memory - the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.
	• We take the data of the program in chunks, called pages, and store them in VM.
		○ If we want to read or execute these pages, they must to sent to physical memory
	• Swap Space - allocated space in hard drive for virtual memory

	• IO Management
	• I/O Devices - Devices that perform input and output
		○ All managed by our kernel
	• Driver is the software that connects the kernel to hardware
	• When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine, it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency.

	• Interacting with the OS: User Space
	• Two ways to interact with user space:
		○ Shell (CLI Shell)
			§ Most common shell called Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
			§ Window's shell is called PowerShell
		○ GUI (Graphical User Interface)
	• Some tasks can only be completed through commands

	• Logs
	• Logs - Files that record system events on our computer, just like a system's diary

	• The Boot Process
	• To start up a computer, we use the term boot
	• BIOS/UEFI - a low level software that initializes our computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go.
	• The BIOS/UEFI runs a process called the POST (Power On Self Test)
		○ Runs a series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in proper working order
	• Next, a boot device would be selected (boot order)
	• Computer would search for a bootloader that loads the operating system.
	• The kernel gets loaded right after.
	• After, System processes and the user space are launched.

	• Choosing an Operating System
	• The operating systems in use by an organization have a lot to do with the applications and systems that they need to run.
	• Modern operating systems do a pretty good job of supporting common hardware.
	• If you have a 64 bit CPU, make sure your OS is also 64 bit.
        • As an IT Support Specialist, you'll install an operating system many times, so using one single disk won't be time efficient or scalable.
